:::: {#hero-heading}
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, where my work focuses on digital political communication and journalism studies. My research examines the structural and discursive factors that contribute to the establishment and reinforcement of social divisions. I focus on issues such as divisive and negative political discourse, the underrepresentation of marginalized groups in political communication and media, and journalism safety.

Alongside my research, I serve as editor of the Political Communication Report and manage the websites and social media channels for the Political Communication divisions of APSA and ICA. I am also an active member of the DigiWorld network and the Digital Media and Society Observatory. I have expertise in data analysis, mixed-methods research, and project management.

**Research interests:** political communication, journalism studies, journalism safety, othering of outgroups, divisive issues in public discourse.
