:::: {#hero-heading}
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, where my work focuses on digital political communication and journalism studies. Alongside my research, I serve as editor of the Political Communication Report and manage the websites and social media channels for the Political Communication divisions of APSA and ICA. I am also an active member of the DigiWorld network and the Digital Media and Society Observatory. I have expertise in data analysis, mixed-methods research, and project management.

My research examines the structural and discursive factors that contribute to the establishment and reinforcement of social divisions. I focus on issues such as divisive and negative political discourse, the underrepresentation of marginalized groups in digital political communication and legacy news media, and journalism safety.

**Research interests:** political communication, journalism studies, journalism safety, othering of outgroups, divisive issues in public discourse.
