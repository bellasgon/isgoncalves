The [Political Communication Teaching Database](https://politicalcommunication.org/resources/) is a collaborative repository supported by the APSA and ICA Political Communication Divisions and designed by [Michael Bossetta](https://michaelbossetta.com/) and I. Our aim is to facilitate the sharing and exploration of teaching materials in political communication. It allows teachers to upload and access syllabi and course materials across a diverse range of subfields.

Users can contribute materials via a shared link (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), and all entries are organized in an interactive dashboard, enabling easy filtering by subject, language, and instruction level. This database serves as a resource for scholars looking to enhance their political communication courses with high-quality, peer-shared content.

## My role in this project:

In this project, I was responsible for coding the back-end and the front-end of this interactive dashboard. Initially, I used shiny to develop it. But after I adapted the code to Apps Script in Google to allow html incorporation.
